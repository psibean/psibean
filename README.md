## Psi (sigh)

An anxious, introverted, selectively extroverted, Software Engineer from down under. Experienced with TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, C, C++, Go, Kotlin, bash, SQL (psql, mysql), php, and more. I have a love for full stack web development, but I have also dabbled in augmented reality development for the HoloLens and HoloLens 2, as well as real time integreated system solutions.

I enjoy working with the Discord bot API, and I'm recently getting into OBS plugin development. My go to stack for personal projects is Node based, React for frontend, express (or koa) for backend with Prisma for ORM, but I am a fan of Django too.

Feel free to contact me on Discord! Psi#2741
